For this assignment, you will refer to the textbook to solve the practice exercises. **Use Python to answer any coding problems (not R, even if indicated in your textbook).** Use Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or a similar software program to complete your assignment. Submit the assignment as a PDF file. Always label your axes and provide titles for any graphs generated on this assignment. Round all quantitative answers to 2 decimal places.

## Problem # 4.1.

For a point estimate of the mean of a population that is assumed to have a normal distribution,
a data scientist decides to use the average of the sample lower and upper quartiles for the $n = 100$
observations, since unlike the sample mean $\bar{Y}$, the quartiles are not affected by outliers. Evaluate
the precision of this estimator compared to $\bar{Y}$ by randomly generating 100,000 samples of size
100 each from a $N(0, 1)$ distribution and comparing the standard deviation of the 100,000
estimates with the theoretical standard error of $\bar{Y}$.

## Problem # 4.2.

For a sequence of observations of a binary random variable, you observe the geometric random
variable (Section 2.2.2) outcome of the first success on observation number $y = 3$. Find and plot
the likelihood function.

## Problem # 4.4.

For the `Students` data file (Exercise 1.2 in Chapter 1) and corresponding population, find the
ML estimate of the population proportion believing in life after death. Construct a Wald 95%
confidence interval, using its formula (4.8). Interpret.

## Problem # 4.5. 

The General Social Survey has asked respondents, “Do you think the use of marijuana should
be made legal or not?” View results at the most recent cumulative datafile at sda.berkeley.edu/archive.htm by entering the variables GRASS and YEAR.

(a) Describe any trend you see since 1973 in the percentage favoring legalization.   
(b) In the 2018 survey, 938 of 1447 were in favor of legalization. Use a Wald or score confidence
interval to determine if this provides sufficient evidence to conclude whether a majority
or a minority of the population support legalization.

## Problem # 4.7.

A social scientist wanted to estimate the proportion of school children in Boston who live in
a single-parent family. She decided to use a sample size such that, with probability 0.95, the
error would not exceed 0.05. How large a sample size should she use, if she has no idea of the
size of that proportion?

## Problem # 4.11.

The observations on number of hours of daily TV watching for the 10 subjects in the 2018 GSS
who identified themselves as Islamic were 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4.

(a)  Construct and interpret a 95% confidence interval for the population mean.
(b)  Suppose the observation of 4 was incorrectly recorded as 24. What would you obtain for
the 95% confidence interval? What does this suggest about potential effects of outliers on
confidence intervals for means?

## Problem # 4.14.

Using the Students data file, for the corresponding population, construct a 95% confidence interval **(a)** for the mean weekly number of hours spent watching TV; **(b)** to compare females and
males on the mean weekly number of hours spent watching TV. In each case, state assumptions,
including the practical importance of each, and interpret results.

## Problem # 4.15.

In the 2018 General Social Survey, when asked whether they believed in life after death, 1017
of 1178 females said yes, and 703 of 945 males said *yes*. Construct 95% confidence intervals
for the population proportions of females and males that believe in life after death and for the
difference between them. Interpret.

## Problem # 4.16.

The `Substance` data file at the book’s website shows a contingency table formed from a survey
that asked a sample of high school students whether they have ever used alcohol, cigarettes,
and marijuana. Construct a 95% Wald confidence interval to compare those who have used or
not used alcohol on whether they have used marijuana, using **(a)** formula (4.13); **(b)** software.
State assumptions for your analysis, and interpret results.

## Problem # 4.18.

A standardized variable $Y$ dealing with a financial outcome is considered to take an unusually
extreme value if $y > 3$. Find $P(Y > 3)$ if **(a)** $Y$ is modeled as having a standard normal distribution $Y\sim N(0, 1)$ , **(b)** $Y$ instead behaves like a ratio of standard normal random variables,
in which case $Y$ has the standard Cauchy distribution (4.11). What do you observe?

## Problem # 4.23.

You want to estimate the proportion of students at your school who answer *yes* when asked
whether governments should do more to address global warming. In a random sample of 10
students, every student says *yes*. Give a point estimate of the probability that the next student
interviewed will answer *yes*, if you use **(a)** ML estimation, **(b)** Bayesian estimation with a
uniform prior distribution.

## Problem # 4.31.

The `Houses` data file at the book’s website lists, for 100 home sales in Gainesville, Florida,
several variables, including the selling price in thousands of dollars and whether the house
is new (1 = yes, 0 = no). Prepare a short report in which, stating all assumptions including
the relative importance of each, you conduct descriptive and inferential statistical analyses to
compare the selling prices for new and older homes.
